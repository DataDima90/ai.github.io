# AWS Glue

- A fully managed ETL service that automates the time-consuming steps of data preparation for analytics.
- Makes it simple and cost-effective to catalog, clean, enrich, and move data reliably between various data stores and streams.
- Is serverless and supports pay-as-you-go model. There is no infrastructure to provision or manage. 


**Usage patterns**
- Crawl your data and generate code to execute, including data transformation and loading
- Integrate with services like Athena, EMR, and Redshift
- Generates customizable, reusable, and portable ETL code using Python and Spark

**Cost**
- Hourly rate, billed by the minute, for crawler and ETL jobs
- Glue Data Catalog: pay a monthly fee for storing and accessing the metadata

**Performance**
- Scale-out Apache Spark environment to load data to target data store
- Specify the number of Data Processing Units (DPUs) to allocate to your ETL job

Connect to many data sources, S3, RDS, or many other types of data sources

**Durability and availability**
- Glue leverages the durability of the data stores to which you connect
- Provides job status and pushes notifications to CloudWatch events
- Use SNS notifications from CloudWatch events to notify of job failures or success

**Scalability and elasticity**
- Runs on top of the Apache Spark for transformation job scale-out execution

**Interfaces**
- Crawlers scan many data store types
- Bulk import Hive metastore into Glue Data Catalog

**Anti-patterns**
- Streaming data, unless Spark Streaming
- Heterogeneous ETL job types; use EMR
- NoSQL databases: not supported as data source
