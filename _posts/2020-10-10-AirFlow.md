# What is ETL?
**ETL** is the process of Extract, Transform and Load of data. ETL collects and processes data from various sources into one data store where it can then be later analyzed.



# Best Practices for ETL Architecture

### Extract Necessary Data only

Wether you are doing ETL batch processing (see link) or real-time streaming (see link), nearly all ETL pipelines extract and load more information than you will actually need. Too much data flowing through the ETL pipelines can slow things down considerably.

**How can you efficiently extract the data you need for BI and Analytics?**
- Data profiling and cleansing is essential in order to remove duplicate and unnecessary information.
- Sometimes the right answer may also be an ELT (extract, load, transform) architecture. With ELT, your data is loaded into the data warehouse before being transformed as necessary. ELT allows you to do ad-hoc transformations when you run a particular anaylsis, which is much faster than transforming all of the data before it enters the data warehouse.

### Optimize Your ETL Workflow
Some tips for ETL optimization are:
- Avoid the use of "SELECT * .." and "SELECT DISTINCT ..." in SQL queries during the extraction phase.
- Reduce in-memory merges and joins as much as possible
- Schedule ETL jobs to run overnight or outside peak hours to avoid potential conflicts with other sessions and processes.

### Use Logging and Monitoring
When designing your ETL architecture, deciding what information to include in your logs should be one of your first priorieties. This may include:
- The timing of each data extraction
- The length of time for each extraction
- The number of rows inserted, changed, or deleted during each extraction
- The transcripts for any system or validation errors


### Choose the Right ETL Tool For You
Before you buy an ETL tool, you must make sure what your considering is compatible with your source and target databases, the type of data you're working with, and your preferred programming language.

Choosing the right ETL tool can only be done when you already have an ETL architecture in mind. You should have a clear idea which data sources and targets will be involved, and which business initiatives your data integration pipelines will support.

# Challenges When Building an ETL Architecture
### Performance
ETL and Performance don't always go together, especially when it comes to batch processing. The transform stage, in particular, is often a performance bottleneck that, if implemented inefficiently, can massively slow down your ETL pipelines.

Imroving ETL performance should be one of your primary goals when designing an ETL architechture. One of the best things you can do to optimize your finite ETL resources is to use parallel and distributed processing (e.g. Apache Hadoop and MapReduce). Other ETL architecture solutions include loading data incrementally and partitioning large tables into smaller ones.

### Data Security and Privacy
Much of the data in your ETL pipelines may be sensitive, confidential, or personally-identifying information. Regulations such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) strictly govern how organizations can handle and manage their consumer data.

Your ETL architecture must carefully preserve the security and confidentiality of sensitive enterprise data at every step.

### Flexibility to Changing Business Requirements
ETL pipelines depend on stability and predictability: the knowledge that source and target databases will remain in the same locations, the same repeated set of transformations enacted on each new batch of data, and so. on.
