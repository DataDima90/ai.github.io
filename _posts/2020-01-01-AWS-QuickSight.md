# AWS QuickSight

BI service to build visualizations, perform ad-hoc analysis, and get business insights from data

**Usage pattern**
- Ad-hoc exploration/visualization
- Dashboard and KPIs
- Analyze and visualize data coming from logs and stored in S3
- Analyze and visualize data in SaaS applications like Salesforce

**Cost**
- Standard $9/user/month; Enterprise $18/user/month
- SPICE capacity: $.25/GB/month Standard; $.38/GB/month Enterprise

**Performance**
- SPICE uses a combination of columnar storage and in-memory technologies
- Machine code generation to run interactive queries on large datasets at low latency

**Durability and availability**
- SPICE automatically replicates data for high availability
- Scale to hundreds of thousands of users
- Simulataneous analytics across AWS data sources

**Scalability and elasticity**
- Fully managed service, scale to terabytes of data

**Interfaces**
- RDS, Aurora, Redshift and Redshift Spectrum, Athena, S3 and S3 Analytics, Apache Spark, IoT Analytics, Presto
- SaaS, applications such as Salesforce

**Anti-patterns**
- Highly formatted canned Reports, better for ad hoc query, analysis and visualization of data
- ETL, Glue better choice

# QuickSight Capabilities and operational characterics

Build visualizations, perform ad-hoc analysis, and quickly get business insights from your data

**Data Source Types**

Use many sources for data analysis, including files, AWS services, and on-premises databases
- Athena, Aurora, Redshift and Redshift Spectrum, S3 and S3 Analytics, Apache Spark, IoT Analytics, RDS, Presto
- Use other data sources by linking or importing them through supported data sources
- Redshift clusters, Athena databases, and RDS instances must be in AWS
- Other data sources must be in one of the following
  - EC2
  - on-prem databases
  - file systems
- Supported file types: CSV and TSV, ELF and CLF, JSON, XLSX

**SPICE**

Super-fast, Parallel, In-memory Calculation Engine (SPICE): engineered to rapidly perform advanced calculations and serve data; in the Enterprise edition data in SPICE is encrypted at rest
- SPICE capacity allocated separately per AWS region
- Can release unused SPICE capacity

**Analysis**
- Use analysis to create and interact with visuals and stories, a container for a set of related visuals and stories
- Use multiple data sets in an analysis, but any given visual can only use one data set
- Share an analysis with other users by emailing them a link; can only share analysis with other users in your QuickSight account
- Use calculated fields to transform your data
  - Many functions, such as extract, formatDate, etc.
  - Aggregate functions

**Visuals**
- Graphical representation of a data set using a diagram, chart, graph, or table
- Supports up to 30 datasets in a single analysis, and up to 30 visuals in a single sheet, and a limit of 20 sheets per analysis

**ML Insights**
- ML insights use machine learning to uncover hidden insights and trends in your data, identify key drivers, and forecast business metrics
- Use the insights generated by ML insights in NLP narratives within dashboards

**Sheets**
- Set of visuals that are viewed together in a single page

**Stories**
- Use a story to play multiple iterations of an analysis sequentially to provide a narrative about the analysis data
- On September 30, 2020, AWS permanently removed all existing stories from QuickSight
- AWS suggests that you recreate stories as visuals that are side-by-side in an analysis as an alternative

**Dashboards**
- Read-only snapshot of an analysis that you can share with other users for reporting
- Preserves the configuration of the analysis at the time of publishing, including filtering, parameters, controls, and sort order
- When a user views the dashboard, it reflects the **current** data in the data sets used by the analysis
- With the enterprise edition a shared dashboard can also be embedded in a website or app
- Drill up/down into data points
