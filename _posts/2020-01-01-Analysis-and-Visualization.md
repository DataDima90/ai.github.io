# Introduction
In the analytics and visualization you use your collected, processed, and transformed data to create actionable insights. 
We need to understand which analysis and visualization methods and tools to use based on your audience's expectations for access and the insight they expect to gain from your visualizations.

# 1. Operational Characteristics Of An Analysis And Visualization Solution

Here we will understand the analysis and visualization components of a data analyitcs solution and which AWS servies implement these concepts


## Purpose Built Analytics Services
Choose the correct approach and tool for your analytics problem. Know the AWS purpose bilt analytics services:
- Athena
- Elasticsearch
- EMR
- DynamoDB
- Kinesis Family (Data Streams, Firehose, Analytics, Video Streams)
- Redshift (Spectrum)
- MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka)
- QuickSight
- Also know where to use
  - S3
  - EC2
  - Glue
  - Lambda





## Analytics Scenarios and their Solutions


### Type of Analysis

**Descriptive analysis (or data mining)**
- Determine what generated the data
- Highest effort

**Diagnostic analysis**
- Determine why data was generated
- Understand root causes of events

**Predictive analysis**
- Determine future outcomes
- Uses descriptive and diagnostic to predict future trends

**Prescriptive analysis**
- Determine action to take
- Uses other three to predict and can be automated

### Analysis Solutions

Identify analytics processing method based on data type collected and analysis type used

**Batch analytics**
- Large volumes of raw data
- Analytics process on a schedule, reports
- Map-reduce type services: EMR

**Interactive analytics**
- Complex queries on complex data at high speed
- See query results immediately
- Athena, Elasticsearch, Redshift

**Streaming analytics**
- Analysis of data that has short shelf-life
- Incrementally ingest data and update metrics
- Kinesis

## Analytics Solutions Patterns

Select the best option for a scenario based on the type of analytics and processing required

### Analytics Solutions Patterns - EMR

Uses the map-reduce technique to reduce large processing problems into small jobs distributed across many nodes in a Hadoop cluster
- On-Demand big data analyitcs
- Event-driven ETL
- Machine Learning predictive analytics
- Clickstream analysis
- Load data warehousees

Do not use for transactional processing or with small data sets

### Analytics Solutions Patterns - Kinesis

Streams data to analytics processing solutions
- Video analytics applications
- Real-time analytics applications
- Analyze IoT device data
- Blog posts and article analytics
- System and application log analytics

Do not use for small-scale throughput or with data with longer shelf-life

#### Analytics Solutions Patterns - Redshift

OLAP using BI tools
- Near real-time analysis of millions of rows of manufacturing data generated by continous manufacturing equipment
- Analyze events from mobile app to gain insight into how users use the application
- Gain value and insights from large, complex, and dispersed datasets
- Make live data generated by range of next-gen security solutions available to large numbers of organizations for analysis

Do not use for OLTP or with small data sets

### Visualization Methods

Understand refresh schedule, delivery method, and access method based on a scenario. We use data from heterogeneous data sources in visualization solution.

### Refresh Schedule - Real-time Scenarios

Scenarios that question the appropriate refresh schedule based on data freshness requirement
Real-time scenarios, typically using Elasticsearch and Kibana
- Refresh_Interval in Elasticsearch domain updates the domain indices; determines query freshness
- Default is every second - expensive, make sure the shards are evenly distributed.
  - Formula: Number of shards for index = number of shards per node * number of data nodes 
- Balance refresh rate cost with decision making needs

### Refresh Schedule - Interactive Scenarios

Real-time scenarios, typically ad-hoc exploration using QuickSight
Refresh SPICE data
- Refresh a data set on a schedule, or you can refresh your data by refreshing the page in an analysis or dashboard
- Use the CreateIngestion API operation to refresh data

Data set based on a direct query and not stored in SPICE, refresh data by opening the data set

### Refresh Schedule - EMR Notebooks

Using EMR Notebooks to query and visualize data. 
Data refreshed every time the notebook is run
- Expensive proces, balance refresh rate cost with decision making needs

## Kibana Visualizations

### Visualization Tool
- Open-source data visualization and exploration tool used for log and time-series analytics, application monitoring, and operational intelligence use cases. Especially where searching is the main need.
- Tight integration with Elasticsearch
- Charts and reports to interactively navigate through large amounts of log data
- Pre-built aggregations and filters
- Dashboards and reports to share

### Kibana Configuration

- To visualize and explore data in Kibana, you must first create index patterns
- Index patterns point Kibana to the Elasticsearch indexes containing the data to explore
- Explore data with Kibana's data discovery functions
- Kibana visualizations are based on Amazon Elasticsearch queries
