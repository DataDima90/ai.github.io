# Scala

## What is Scala

- Scala stands for scalable language
- Compiler based programming language
- Lazy evaluated language
- Object oriented and functional programming
- On compilation scala generates byte code which can be executed on JVM
- Spark is developed using Scala and spark APIs are well integrated with Scala

The central drive behind Scala is to make life easier and more productive for the developer - and that includes me. Scala does this with three principal techniques:
1. It cuts down on boilerplate, so programmers can concentrage on the logic of their problems
2. It adds expressiveness, by tightly fusing object-oriented and functional programming concepts in one language
3. It protects existing investments by running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and interoperating seamlessly with Java.

## Setting up Scala

We skip for now!!!

## Basic programming

val-- immutable variable
var- mutable variable

Scala functional programming concepts

```scala

  /**
  * Example of a function
  */
  var lb=1
  var ub=10
  var total=0

  def sum(lb: Int, ub: Int): Int = {
    var total=0
    for (i <- lb to ub){
      total=total+i
    }
    total
  }
  
  println(sum(1,2))

  /**
  * Example of a Higher Order Function
  */
  def hsum(func: Int => Int, lb: Int, ub: Int): Int = {
    var total=0
    for (i <- lb to ub){
      total=total+func(i)
    }
    total
  }

  def id(x: Int): Int = x

  def square(x: Int): Int = x*x

  println(hsum(square, 1,2))
  
  /**
  * Example of a Higher Order Function that returns a function
  */
  def URLBuilder(ssl:Boolean, domainname:String): (String, String) => String = {
    val schema = if (ssl) "https://" else "http://"
    (endpoint: String, query: String) => s"$schema$domainname/$endpoint?$query";
  }
  
  val domainname = "www.scala.com"
  val endpoint = "user"
  val query = "id=1"
  
  val GetURL = URLBuilder(ssl = true, domainname = domainname)
  val url = GetURL(endpoint, query)
  
  println(url)
```

Scala object-oriented concepts

```scala
  class ctr {
    var value = 0
    def incurr(){value+=1}
    def cur(){value=value}
  }
  
  /**
  * Example of getter and setter of public and private variables
  */
  class getter_setter {
  val a = 0
  private var b = 0

  def getter: Int = b

  def setter(in:Int) {b = in}

  override def toString: String = "GS(a: " + " b: " + b +")"
  }
  
  /**
  * Example of a primary constructor
  */
    class pr_const (acc_count: Int, name: String) {
    print("Hello " +  name)
    
    def customer_details(): Unit = {
      println("Acccount ID: " + acc_count)
    }
  }
```
