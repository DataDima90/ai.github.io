# AWS EMR

Uses Hadoop to distribute data and processing across a resizeable cluster of EC2 instances

**Usage patterns**
- Reduces large processing problems and data sets into smaller jobs and distributes them across many compute nodes in a Hadoop cluster
- Log processing and analytics
- Large ETL data movement
- Ad targeting, click stream analytics
- Predictive analytics

**Cost**
- Pay for the hours the cluster is up
- EC2 pricing options (On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot)
- EMR price is in addition to EC2 price

**Performance**
- Driven by type/number of EC2 instances
- Ephemeral or long-running

- Fault tolerant for core node failures and continues job execution if a slave node goes down

**Durability and availability**
- Starts p a new node if core node fails
- Will not replace nodes if all nodes in the cluster fail
- Monitor for node failures through CloudWatch

**Scalability and elasticity**
- Resize your running cluster: add core nodes, add/remove task nodes

**Interfaces**
- Tools on top of Hadoop: Hive, Pig, Spark, HBase, Presto
- Kinesis Connector: directly read and query data from Kinesis Data Streams

**Anti-patterns**
- Small data sets; Made for big data sets
- ACID transactions; RDS is a better choice
