# AWS Data Analytics Solutions

## Type of Analysis

**Descriptive analysis (or data mining)**
- Determine what generated the data
- Highest effort

**Diagnostic analysis**
- Determine why data was generated
- Understand root causes of events

**Predictive analysis**
- Determine future outcomes
- Uses descriptive and diagnostic to predict future trends

**Prescriptive analysis**
- Determine action to take
- Uses other three to predict and can be automated

## Analytics Processing Methods

Identify analytics processing method based on data type collected and analysis type used

**Batch analytics**
- Large volumes of raw data
- Analytics process on a schedule, reports
- Map-reduce type services: EMR

**Interactive analytics**
- Complex queries on complex data at high speed
- See query results immediately
- Athena, Elasticsearch, Redshift

**Streaming analytics**
- Analysis of data that has short shelf-life
- Incrementally ingest data and update metrics
- Kinesis


# Analytics Solutions Patterns

Select the best option for a scenario based on the type of analytics and processing required

## Analytics Solutions Patterns - EMR

Uses the map-reduce technique to reduce large processing problems into small jobs distributed across many nodes in a Hadoop cluster
- On-Demand big data analyitcs
- Event-driven ETL
- Machine Learning predictive analytics
- Clickstream analysis
- Load data warehousees

Do not use for transactional processing or with small data sets

## Analytics Solutions Patterns - Kinesis

Streams data to analytics processing solutions
- Video analytics applications
- Real-time analytics applications
- Analyze IoT device data
- Blog posts and article analytics
- System and application log analytics

Do not use for small-scale throughput or with data with longer shelf-life

## Analytics Solutions Patterns - Redshift

OLAP using BI tools
- Near real-time analysis of millions of rows of manufacturing data generated by continous manufacturing equipment
- Analyze events from mobile app to gain insight into how users use the application
- Gain value and insights from large, complex, and dispersed datasets
- Make live data generated by range of next-gen security solutions available to large numbers of organizations for analysis

Do not use for OLTP or with small data sets
