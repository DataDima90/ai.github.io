# Redshift

- Fully-managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service for analyzing data using BI tools
- Entreprise-class data warehouse and relational database query and management system
- Connect using many types of client applications
  - BI
  - Reporting
  - Analytics
- Build multi-stage query operations that retrieve, compare, and evaluate large amounts of data
- Efficient storage and optiimum query performance
  - Massively parallel processing
  - Columnar data storage
  - Very efficient, targeted data compression encoding schemes

**Usage patterns**
- Designed for online analytical processing (OLAP) using business intelligence tools
- Analyze sales data for multiple products
- Analyze ad impressions and clicks
- Aggregate gaming data
- Analyze social trends

**Cost**
- Charges based on the size and number of cluster nodes
- Backup sotrage > provisioned storage size and backups stored after cluster termiantion billed at standard S3 rate

**Performance**
- Columnar storage, data compression, and zone maps to reduce query I/O
- Paralllizes and distributes SQL operations to take advantage of all available resources

- Automatically detects and replaces a failed node in your data warehouse cluster

**Durability and availability**
- Failed node cluster is read-only until replacement node is provisioned and added to the DB
- Cluster remains available on drive failure; Redshift mirrors your data across the cluster

**Scalability and elasticity**
- With API change the number, or type, of nodes while cluster remains live

**Interfaces**
- JDBC and ODBC drivers for use with SQL clients
- S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, BI tools such as QuickSight

**Anti-patterns**
- Small data sets, better big data sets
- OLTP, better OLAP
- Unstructured data
- Blob data, S3 better choice

**Analytics Solutions Patterns with Redshift**

OLAP using BI tools
- Near real-time analysis of millions of rows of manufacturing data generated by continous manufacturing equipment
- Analyze events from mobile app to gain insight into how users use the application
- Gain value and insights from large, complex, and dispersed datasets
- Make live data generated by range of next-gen security solutions available to large numbers of organizations for analysis

**Redshift Architecture**
- Based on PostgreSQL
- Clients connect via JDBC and ODBC
- Built upon clusters
  - One or more compute nodes
  - If greater than 1 compute nodes, a leader node coordinates the compute nodes and communicates with external client apps
- Leader node
  - Build execution plans to execute database operations, such as complex queries
  - Compiles code and distributes it to the compute nodes, also assigns a portion of the data to each compute node
- Compute nodes
  - Executes the compiled code and sends intermediate results back to the leader node for final aggregation
  - Has dedicated CPU, memory, and attached disk storage, which are determined by the node type - node types: RA3, DC2, DS2
  - User data is stored on compute nodes
- Node slices
  - Compute node are partitioned into slices
  - Slices are allocated a portiion of the node's memory and disk space
  - Processes a part of the workload assigned to the node
  - Leader node distributes data to the slices, divides query workload to the slices
  - Slices work in parallel to complete our queries
  - Assign a column as a distribution key when we create our table on Redshift
  - When we load data into our table, rows are distributed to the node slices by the table distribution key - facilitates parallel processing

Moving data to and from Redshift
- Redshift integrates well with AWS servies to move, transform, and load our data quickly and reliably
  - S3
  - DynamoDB
  - EMR via SSH and COPY Command from Redshift
  - EC2 via SSH and COPY Command from Redshift
  - Data Pipeline
  - DMS
