# Summary


# Data Engineering

## Step 1: Gather Data

Gather data for problem defining
- Gather own unique data
- Publicly available data
  - Kaggle
  - Reddit
  - Google Dataset Search
  - UCI Machine Learning Resository
- Scrape HTML pages
  - Beautiful Soup

Several AWS services to help gather data
  - Amazon Data Pipeline
  - AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)
  - AWS Glue
  - Amazon Sagemaker
  - Amazon Athena

## Step 2: Handling Missing Data

Several approaches to handle this problem
- Null value replacement
- Mode/median/average value replacement
- Remove the entire record
- Model-based imputation
  - Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Deep Learning
- Interpolation / Extrapolation
- Forward filing / Backward filing
- Hot deck imputation

## Step 3: Feature Engineering

AKA Dimensionality Reduction
- Reduce the number of features by creating new features from existing features
- feature extraction creates a new, smaller set of features that stills caputers most of the useful information

## Step 4: Feature Selection

Use feature selction to filter irrelevant or redundant features from our dataset
- Feature selection requires normalization
- Feature selection removes features from our dataset - **Variance Thresholds**

- Rank the importance of existing features
- Remove less important features
- Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - An unsupervissed learning algorithm that reduces the number of features while still retaining as much information as possible

## Step 5: Encode Categorical Values

- Encode categorical data to integers
  - Be careful with ordinal features
- Binarizer Encoding: for features of a binary nature
- Label Encoding: may imply ordinality, can use Ordinal Encoder
- One-hot-encoding: Change nominal categorical values such as 'true', 'false', or 'rainy', 'sunny' to numerical values

## Step 6: Numerical Feature Engineering

- Transform numerical values so machine learning algorithms can better analyze them
- Change numerical values so all values are on the same scale
  - Normalization: rescales the values to a range of [0, 1]
  - Standardization: rescales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (unit variance)
  - Binning

## Step 7: Training and Testing Datasets

- Split dataset into a training subset and a testing subst
  - Typically a 80% / 20% split
